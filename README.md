Thirdly, I would open the computer case and verify that the power button is properly connected to the motherboard. I would unplugg and replug to check if it worked. If not, I would check the manual/online to verify the correct power ON pins and try manually jumping them.

Then, I would check the CMOS battery on the motherboard and either reset it by unplugging it, jumping it, or replacing it.
